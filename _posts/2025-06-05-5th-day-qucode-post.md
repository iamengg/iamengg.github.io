Today , I delved into foundational topics of quantum theory :Tensor products, Kronecker product, inner/outer product, unitary operators.

All are fundamental for manipulating and understanding quantum states in quantum computing.

What i learned - 
-**tensor product** is a mathematical operation used to combine quantum states or operators of multiple quantum systems (like qubits) into a single, larger system. It describes how the state of a composite system is built from the states of its subsystems, capturing all possible combinations of their states.
- **Kronecker Product**: Scales quantum systems to describe multi-qubit states and gates.
- **Inner Product**: Quantifies state overlap and measurement probabilities.
- **Outer Product**: Builds operators for projections and state transformations.
- **Unitary Operators**: Ensure reversible, norm-preserving transformations, enabling quantum gates and algorithms.
